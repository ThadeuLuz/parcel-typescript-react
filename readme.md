# Parcel Typescript React

A simple opinionated boilerplate of how I like to setup my static react projects, including:

- Parcel
- Typescript
- React/React-DOM
- Material-UI
- Prettier and Eslint
- VSCode Setup
- Husky hooks for commit

## Instalation

1. Run `npm i` on root
1. Run `npm start`
1. Hack away

If you use VSCode it is a good idea to install [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) extensions.

## Contribution

PRs are welcome.
