# Parcel Typescript React

A simple opinionated boilerplate of how I like to setup my static react projects, including:

- Parcel
- Typescript
- React/React-DOM
- Material-UI
- Prettier and Eslint
- VSCode Setup
- Husky hooks to lint fix staged files only

## Instalation

1. Run `npm i` to install packages
1. Run `npm start` to run dev server
1. Hack away

If you use VSCode it is a good idea to install [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) extensions.
